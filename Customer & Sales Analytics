#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in order to customer and order data.

SELECT count (orderID) AS January_Orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'orderID'

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

WHERE Product = 'iPhone' 
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'orderID'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT product, min(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT orderid, quantity, price, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

SELECT SUM(quantity), price, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price

SELECT product
, sum(Quantity) * price AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product

    #Round total#

SELECT product
, round(sum(Quantity) * price,2) AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
